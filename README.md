# Artificial_Intelligence_Project
This is my year-3 university project on Python and Artificial Intelligence. This project demonstrates my ability to code in Python as well as implement techniques such as data cleansing, PCA and K-means clustering as a solution to an unsupervised learning problem.
The main file attached is a .MD file. Tu run this file, simply open in Jupyter Notebook then save/run as a IPYNB file.

Two project reports have been added: the first detailing some of the steps followed and the problems encountered in the overall project, the second detailing the contributions I made to this 2-person project.
